# MIT-Loan-Default-Prediction
This repository contains my capstone project for the MIT Data Science courses. The project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict loan defaults using the Home Equity (HMEQ) dataset. The model aims to be accurate, interpretable, and fair, mitigating potential biases in the loan approval process.
